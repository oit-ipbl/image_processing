# Image processing
- You have to read all documents.
- You have to do `practice` tasks and `exercise` tasks which are in each section.
- There are `challenge` tasks in `Image processing advanced` section.
    - We strongly recommend all students read the documents on `challenge` tasks because there would be many hints or important information helping you done the final tasks.
    - Especially you want to work hard about image processing, please try to complete `challenge` tasks if possible. 
- Please check the following official documents if you want to know the other functions and more details about the OpenCV or the MediaPipe.
