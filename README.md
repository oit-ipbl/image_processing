# Image processing
- You have to do all the following `Pre-learning Assignments`.

- There are `challenge` tasks in `Image processing advanced` section.
    - We strongly recommend all students read the documents on all `challenge` tasks because there would be many hints or important information helping you done the final tasks.
    - If you have time to spare,  please try to complete `challenge` tasks. 

- The following `Sample programs` will help you develop more advanced image processing programs. Work with your team members to try out the samples.

# Pre-learning Assignments
- [Image processing basics for static images](basics/basics_static.md)
- [Image processing basics for video image](basics/basics_02.md)
- [MediaPipe Pose](mediapipe/pose.md)
- [MediaPipe Hands](mediapipe/hands.md)
- [MediaPipe Face](mediapipe/face.md)
- [Image processing advanced](advanced/holistic.md)

# Sample Programs
- [Resizing images](samples/resizing_images.md)
