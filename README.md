# Image processing
- You have to do all the following `Pre-learning Assignments`.

- There are `challenge` tasks in `Image processing advanced` section.
    - We strongly recommend all students read the documents on all `challenge` tasks because there would be many hints or important information helping you done the final tasks.
    - Especially you want to work hard about image processing, please try to complete `challenge` tasks if possible. 

- The following `Sample programs` will help you develop more advanced image processing programs. Work with your team members to try out the samples.

- Pre-learning Assignments
  - [Image processing basics for static images](basics/basics_01.md)
  - [Image processing basics (2)](basics/basics_02.md)
  - [MediaPipe Hands](mediapipe/hands.md)
  - [MediaPipe Pose](mediapipe/pose.md)
  - [MediaPipe Face](mediapipe/face.md)
  - [Image processing advanced](advanced/holistic.md)

- Sample Programs
  - [Resizing images](samples/resizing_images.md)

- Please check the following official documents if you want to know the other functions and more details about the OpenCV or the MediaPipe.
